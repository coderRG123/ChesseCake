### First,in a food processor crush the graham crackers for 1 minute to form fine crumbs. Add melted butter and pulse for another minute to combine.Pour graham cracker crumbs into the bottom of a spring form pan. Place a layer of plastic wrap on top of the graham cracker crumbs and press down until a solid crust forms. Bake at 375°F for 10 minutes and let cool on wire rack. In large bowl, with your mixer at medium speed, beat cream cheese and sugar until smooth and fluffy. Beat in flour and vanilla until well combined. Reduce speed to low and beat in eggs and egg yolk, one at a time, beating well after each addition. Beat in milk until blended.Pour batter into pan and get rid of air bubbles by popping them with a toothpick. Don't shake or bang the pan — that will break the crust. Once ready, transfer to oven. Bake at 300°F until edges are lightly golden and center wobbles slightly, about 55 minutes.To guarantee a firm yet jiggly cheesecake, leave it in the oven for an hour once it's baked. Simply turn off the oven, leave the door ajar, and let it rest (abrupt temperature changes often cause cracked crusts). When cool, place the cheesecake in the refrigerator and let chill overnight.The next morning, release cheesecake from the pan by loosening the sides with a knife or metal spatula. Unlatch the pan and lift up. Then you are done!!
